# CSS-HTML-JavaScript-Website


In this assignment, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a completely 
customizable and user-friendly website for my motel. Home, Accommodation, Facilities 
and Services, Contact, and Reservation are the five pages that I have created. HTML is 
the standard markup language for structuring webpage content, CSS is used to design 
the page, and JavaScript is used to make buttons work.

Homepage

The website's homepage is kept basic. I utilized a darkslategrey backdrop and a picture 
as a container for the hotel's brief description. The Home, Accommodation, Facilities 
and Services, Contact, and Reservation pages are all linked from the navigation bar. 
The user may just click these links to be sent to the appropriate page. The description 
boxes at the bottom of the page have been divided into several containers and 
divisions. The button was designed to animate and change color using the built-in CSS 
function hover, which would transfer the visitor to the reservation page. This website 
provides a quick overview of the hotel and its amenities to the user.

Accommodation

The Accommodation page allows customers to see a list of all the many types of rooms 
that our hotels have to offer, as well as the price, size, and amenities that each room 
provides. The users' list of rooms and details is displayed in a table. The first column of 
the table lists the room type and an image of the room, followed by size and price/night, 
along with a button link to the reservation page.

Facilities and Services

This website informs users about the hotel's numerous amenities and gives information 
about those amenities and services. The user may examine photographs of the service 
by hovering over each of the description boxes.

Contact

The contact page assists the user in sending us an email. The user may fill in the 
appropriate blanks in each text field and submit the form by clicking the send button. 
This page also includes the hotel's address and email address, which may be found in 
the HTML footer. In HTML, the contact us box is in a form class which uses text field to 
hold the information.

Reservation

The HTML form functionality is also used on the reservation page. The user may quickly 
fill in their name, contact information, and the date, as well as select the number of 
guests and room types from a drop-down menu. Then, to reserve the room, click the 
book now button. Text fields and id is implemented in this page for the functionality of 
the reservation page
